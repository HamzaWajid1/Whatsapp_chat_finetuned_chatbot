# WhatsApp Chat Analysis Project

üì± **Analyzing and Processing WhatsApp Chats with Python** üêç

## Overview

This project involves loading and analyzing WhatsApp chat data for two individuals. The process includes converting the chat into a DataFrame, performing preprocessing tasks, merging, removing, and altering different chats. Regular expressions are applied to modify the chats, and data visualization is conducted on the DataFrame with columns such as date, username, message, Dates, Time, day, letters, words. Additionally, word counts are generated.

## Data Processing and Visualization

- **Loading Data:** WhatsApp chat data is loaded and converted into a DataFrame.
- **Preprocessing:** Various preprocessing tasks are carried out on the chat data.
- **Merging and Removal:** Chats are merged, and unwanted elements are removed.
- **Regular Expression:** Regular expressions are applied to modify the chats.
- **Visualization:** The DataFrame is visualized with columns such as date, username, message, Dates, Time, day, letters, words.

## Language Model Fine-Tuning
